# üõ°Ô∏è DataCom Cybersecurity Job Simulation (via Forage)

Welcome! This project documents my participation in the **DataCom Cybersecurity Consulting Job Simulation** hosted by Forage.

The simulation involved two realistic cybersecurity tasks ‚Äî one focused on **threat intelligence** and the other on **risk assessment**. My goal here wasn‚Äôt just to complete the assignment, but to treat it like a real-world client engagement. I focused on clarity, structure, and making recommendations that make sense in the context of a smaller organization with limited resources.

I‚Äôm using this repo as both a portfolio project and a personal checkpoint ‚Äî something I can look back on to see how my thinking evolves as I grow in the cybersecurity space (especially GRC).

## üìÅ Contents

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Threat Intelligence Report](https://github.com/DCodeDavonte/DataCom-Cybersecurity-Job-Simulation/blob/main/threat-intelligence-report.md) | A high-level APT34 profile written for a potentially non-technical leadership audience. Includes industry targeting, tactics (MITRE-aligned), and mitigation strategies. |
| [Threat Intelligence Reflection](https://github.com/DCodeDavonte/DataCom-Cybersecurity-Job-Simulation/blob/main/threat-intelligence-report-reflection.md) | My thought process behind the report ‚Äî how I chose sources, what I learned, and how I structured the deliverable like a consultant would. |
| [Risk Assessment Report](https://github.com/DCodeDavonte/DataCom-Cybersecurity-Job-Simulation/blob/main/risk-assessment-report.md) | A simulated risk assessment for a small health clinic, including inherent/current/target risks and practical recommendations. |
| [Risk Assessment Reflection](https://github.com/DCodeDavonte/DataCom-Cybersecurity-Job-Simulation/blob/main/risk-assessment-report-reflection.md) | A detailed breakdown of how I approached risk scoring, selected scenarios, and balanced realistic controls with strong security posture. |
| [Risk Assessment Excel Template](https://github.com/DCodeDavonte/DataCom-Cybersecurity-Job-Simulation/blob/main/Risk%20Assessment_Health%20Clinic.xlsx) | Downloadable supporting file from Task 2. Includes risk scoring matrix (inherent, current, and target). |

## üß† Why This Project Matters

This simulation helped me strengthen key skills I care about:

- Thinking like a consultant, not just a technician
- Communicating security risks to non-technical decision-makers
- Prioritizing controls that are feasible, not just ideal
- Building reports that are actionable, readable, and grounded in real-world logic

It also reminded me how much I enjoy the advisory and analytical side of cybersecurity ‚Äî asking ‚ÄúWhat if?‚Äù, mapping it to risk, and giving the client something they can actually use.

## üîó Related Skills Highlighted

- Threat intelligence (APT profiling)
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Risk matrix scoring (likelihood √ó consequence)
- GRC fundamentals (least privilege, supply chain risks, user awareness)
- Technical communication and business-aligned reporting

## üìå Next Steps

Eventually I may add:

- The original simulation prompt (for context)
- Sample visuals or matrix exports
- Expanded sections showing how I‚Äôd handle this in a full-time role
